In this tutorial we will learn how to write codes with [java-programming-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

## what-is-java?
Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

## 1) introduction
Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. [from-wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)

### example-of-programming
Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.

#### purpose-of-programming
Human manually type documents with bunch of repetitive inputs but with help of programming an application would help to reduce the work load of an employee or a person.
